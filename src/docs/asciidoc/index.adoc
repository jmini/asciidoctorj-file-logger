== Description

When AsciidoctorJ converts a document, it writes issues to the console (malformed AsciiDoc constructs, missing attribute, errors…).
This extension collect those issues and to write them into a single log file: `build/asciidoctor.log`.
This file can be then used by other tools.
For example the Jenkins link:https://wiki.jenkins.io/x/1YTeCQ[Warnings Next Generation Plugin], can collect the asciidoctor issues in order to display them as part of the job result.

=== AsciidoctorJ version

The latest version of this extension is built and tested with version `{asciidoctorj-version}` of `org.asciidoctor:asciidoctorj`.

== Usage

The extension is published on maven central and can be directly consumed from a gradle build.

include::{rootdir}/usage/gradle-example/README.adoc[leveloffset=1, tags=gradle-integration]

For a complete example, see: git-link:usage/gradle-example/build.gradle[build.gradle, branch="master"]

=== Output example

The content of the `build/asciidoc.adoc` example can look like this:

.Example content for the log file
----
/tmp/file.adoc|5|ERROR|include file not found: /tmp/other.adoc
/tmp/file.adoc|7|HIGH|list item index: expected 1, got 8
UNKNOWN|0|HIGH|skipping reference to missing attribute: bla
----

=== Integration with Jenkins

You need to install the link:https://wiki.jenkins.io/x/1YTeCQ[Warnings Next Generation Plugin].

In "Configure System" page of Jenkins, search for the "Groovy Based Warnings Parsers" section and create a new "Groovy Based Warnings Parsers" item:

image:jenkins_configure.png[Groovy Based Warnings Parsers configuration]

Configure the item with following values:

* Name: `Asciidoctor Logs`
* Id: `asciidoctor`
* Regular Expression: `+(.*)\|(\d+)\|(.*)\|(.*)+`

And following mapping script:

.Groovy script to create log entries
----
import edu.hm.hafner.analysis.Severity
return builder
    .setFileName(matcher.group(1))
    .setLineStart(Integer.parseInt(matcher.group(2)))
    .setSeverity(Severity.valueOf(matcher.group(3)))
    .setMessage(matcher.group(4))
    .setCategory("Asciidoctor")
    .buildOptional();
----

In your build configuration, in the "Post-build Actions" section, add a "Record compiler warnings and static analysis results" item:

image:build_configure.png[Record compiler warnings and static analysis results configuration]

Configure the item with following values:

* Tool: `Groovy Parser`
* Parser: `Asciidoctor Logs`
* Report File Pattern: `build/asciidoctor.log`

Here the same configuration as Jenkins pipeline script:

.Jenkins pipeline configuration
----
recordIssues(tools: [groovyScript(parserId: 'asciidoctor', pattern: 'build/asciidoctor.log')])
----

== Source Code

As for any grade plugin, the source code of the plugin is available in the git-link:src/[src/] folder.

=== Build

This project is using gradle.

Command to build the sources locally:

----
./gradlew build
----

Command to deploy to your local maven repository:

----
./gradlew publishToMavenLocal
----

Command to build the documentation page:

----
./gradlew asciidoctor
----

The output of this command is an HTML page located at `<git repo root>/build/docs/html5/index.html`.

==== For project maintainers

`signing.gnupg.keyName` and `signing.gnupg.passphrase` are expected to be set in your local `gradle.properties` file to be able to sign.
`sonatypeUser` and `sonatypePassword` are expected to be set in order to be able to publish to a distant repository.
					
Command to build and publish the result to maven central:

----
./gradlew publishToNexus
----

Command to upload the documentation page on GitHub pages:

----
./gradlew gitPublishPush
----

Command to perform a release:

----
./gradlew release -Prelease.useAutomaticVersion=true
----

==== Using ssh-agent

Some tasks requires pushing into the distant git repository (release task or updating the `gh-pages` branch).
If they are failing with errors like this:
----
org.eclipse.jgit.api.errors.TransportException: ... Permission denied (publickey).
---- 

Then `ssh-agent` can be used.
----
eval `ssh-agent -s`
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
----
